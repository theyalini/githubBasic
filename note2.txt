NOW I GOING TO SHARE SOME OF THE COMMANDS 

Insert --->add --->commit --->push --->

This is the order we eed to work on it 

COMMANDS :
cd file name 
git init --> It is used in place where we need to have the git to be there so that there will be a connection between the local and the github repository
